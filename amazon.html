                <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
                <p>The aim of this project was to develop a predictive model to forecast sales on Amazon based on historical data. By analyzing key features such as product categories, pricing, customer ratings, and reviews, 
                    I sought to identify patterns that could help Amazon and its sellers make data-driven decisions to maximize profits and improve customer satisfaction.</p><br>
                    <p>Dataset:</p>
                    <p>The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and contained a wide range of information, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Product Details:</strong> Product ID, product name, category, and pricing (actual and discounted).</li>
                        <li><strong>Customer Feedback</strong> Customer ratings, rating count, and detailed product reviews.</li>
                    </ul><br>

                    <p>
                        Amazon Sales Forecasting to show the during train and test in actual and discount prices relationship. scatter plots showing the relationship between actual price and discount price,
                         with a fitted regression line (blue line) predicting the linear relationship between these two variables. , 
                        Using Machine learning language to Test set(Test Data Evaluation)

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The model assumes a linear relationship between the discount price and the actual price, 
                        which is represented by the straight blue line in both plots.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Model Evaluation: If the red dots are close to the blue line, it indicates that the model is making accurate predictions on the test set. 
                        However, any points significantly off the line suggest potential prediction errors or outliers.
                         In this plot, we can observe a reasonably strong correlation between actual and discount prices, with some larger deviations as discount prices increase.
                    </p><br>

                    <img src="images/actual and discount prices relationship_trained.png">
                    <p>
                        The plot shows the model's fit to the training data, 
                        where the model is expected to perform well as it was trained on this data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The plot of the training data shows a strong correlation between discount and actual prices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The red data points being close to the line suggest that the model is capable of predicting the actual price based on the discount price during training.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The red dots being closer to the blue line suggests a strong correlation between the actual and discount prices during training.  
                        In this plot, most red dots are closely aligned with the regression line, confirming that the model learned the relationship well from the training data.

                    <p>Observation: This plot likely visualizes how the actual price and discounted price relate to each other, potentially using a scatterplot.</p>
                    <p>Outliers: Any points far from the trendline might represent products that have an unusually high or low discount, 
                        which could be a focal point for understanding unique pricing strategies or promotional offers.</p>
                    <p>Actionable Insights: You could conclude that the discount pricing strategy appears consistent with the actual price of the products, 
                        but further analysis on products with extreme discounts (outliers) might reveal opportunities for deeper insights on pricing anomalies.</p><br>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Emphasis: This visualization highlights the need for price evaluation strategies, 
                        especially for categories with substantial discounts. 
                        Business leaders can also use this chart to determine the effectiveness of their discount campaigns
                         and whether they are boosting sales or eroding profit margins.</p><br>

                    <p><strong>PIE CHART</strong>: Sum of Total Actual Price by Category</p>
                    <p>Description: The pie chart breaks down the total actual sales value contributed by each category</p>
                    <p>Key Insights:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Electronics (Mobile) stands out as the highest revenue-generating category, 
                            contributing 44.11% of total sales. This suggests a strong market demand for mobile electronics,
                             driving a significant portion of revenue.</li>
                             <li>Other categories, such as Home & Kitchen and Wearable Electronics, also make noticeable contributions, albeit smaller.</li>
                    </ul>

                                <li>The trend reveals that the actual prices are higher than the discounted prices, which is expected, but certain categories show steeper declines in discounted prices. This indicates that aggressive discounts are applied to particular categories, likely to move inventory quickly.</li>
                                <li>Electronics categories, particularly Mobile and Accessories, maintain a strong actual price despite significant discounts, showing a balance between price reductions and sales volume.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Emphasis:This visualization is key to understanding how discounts affect revenue. 
                                By identifying categories where heavy discounting occurs, 
                                the company can re-evaluate its pricing strategies to strike a better balance between maintaining high sales volumes and ensuring profitability.</p><br>
                                <p><strong>SCATTER PLOT</strong>: Sum of Total Actual Price and Count of Discount Percentage by Category</p>

                                    <li>Categories with higher discount percentages but lower total actual prices suggest the products are heavily discounted to boost sales. 
                                        These categories might be struggling with lower demand.</li>
                                        <li>Conversely, categories with high actual prices and low discount percentages suggest premium products that can sustain a higher price point without needing heavy discounts, such as in the Mobile Electronics category.</li>

                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>Conclusions and Strategic Recommendations</strong></p>
                                <p>By utilizing Power BI to analyze the Amazon sales dataset, I derived several key insights into the company’s sales, pricing, 
                                    and customer engagement strategies. Here are the primary takeaways:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <ol>Category Dominance: Electronics and Mobile is the top revenue-generating category, and strategies to maintain or expand this market should be a focus.</ol>
                                        <ol>Discount Optimization: Categories with significant discount percentages may need to be reassessed. Products that rely heavily on discounts to drive sales may benefit from improved marketing strategies or product positioning to sustain their pricing power.</ol>
                                        <ol>Customer Engagement: High ratings in categories like Computers & Accessories indicate strong customer satisfaction and loyalty. These categories may not require aggressive discounting but should be promoted as premium offerings to maximize profitability.</ol>
                                        <ol>Revenue Diversification: The pie chart breakdown shows that a small number of categories contribute the majority of the revenue. This concentration suggests that expanding lower-performing categories could create new revenue streams, reducing reliance on top categories.</ol>


                                    </ul><br>
