                <h1 id="amaz">Audio AI Chatbot for Customer Queries</h1><br>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
                <p>The goal of this project was to build an AI chatbot capable of understanding user queries via audio input and providing accurate, spoken responses. 
                    This chatbot leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
                    and speech recognition technologies to enhance user interaction, providing a seamless, conversational experience
                     similar to virtual assistants like Google Assistant and Siri.
                    </p><br>

                    <h4><b>Process Overview:</b></h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Speech Recognition (Converting Audio to Text): 
                                The first step involves capturing the user's voice and converting the spoken words into text. 
                                For this, I integrated Google’s Speech-to-Text API. The key stages of this process include:
                                <ul>
                                <li>Audio Input Capture: The user speaks into a microphone, and the audio data is recorded.</li>
                                <li>Audio Processing: The captured audio is converted into a machine-readable format.</li>
                                <li>Speech Recognition: Using Google’s Speech-to-Text API, the processed audio is transcribed into text for further analysis.</li>
                                </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol><br>
                    <h4><b>Challenges Tackled:</b></h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensuring the chatbot could handle varying accents and speech patterns.</li>
                            <li>Preprocessing noisy audio data to improve transcription accuracy.</li>
                        </ul><br>

                        <h4><b>Natural Language Understanding:</b></h4> 
                        <p>After converting speech to text, the next step was understanding the user’s query. 
                            This required integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, 
                            leveraging the Google Knowledge Graph API for extracting meaningful insights. Key stages include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Intent Recognition:</b>The chatbot classifies the user’s intent by analyzing the text. Whether the user is asking for information, seeking a recommendation, or initiating a general conversation, the chatbot identifies the query type.</li>
                                <li><b>Entity Extraction:</b>Relevant entities from the query (e.g., products, services, locations) are identified to provide context-aware responses.</li>
                            </ul><br>

                            <h4><b>technologies used:</b></h4>
                            <p><b>Google Knowledge Graph API</b>: To fetch real-time information based on the recognized entities and intent.</p>
                            <p><b>Generating Responses (Text-to-Speech Conversion):</b> Once the chatbot understands the user query, it generates a meaningful response. Instead of delivering responses solely as text, the chatbot speaks back to the user. This was achieved using Google’s Text-to-Speech API.</p><br>
